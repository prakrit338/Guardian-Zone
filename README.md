This project implements a biometric security system for home, shop, or office access control using Arduino. 
The R307 fingerprint sensor, with its built-in memory and controller, enables efficient storage and comparison of fingerprints. This optical scanner integrates seamlessly with embedded hardware platforms, making it accessible and user-friendly. The project addresses security concerns associated with conventional lock systems, offering an advanced solution that minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.

The implementation involves a single sensor and PCB, emphasizing cost efficiency without compromising effectiveness. This device serves as a biometric key, enhancing security measures and providing a streamlined approach to access control. Overall, the project contributes to the development of a reliable, fingerprint-based home automation system, ensuring only authorized individuals gain entry to designated spaces.
